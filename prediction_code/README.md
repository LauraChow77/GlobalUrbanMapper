# `prediction_code` Directory

This is the prediction code directory for the Global Urban Mapper (GUM) project. It provides the necessary scripts and resources to perform urban mapping predictions using the `GUM` model. The inclusion of Colab-compatible code ensures that researchers without personal GPU resources can leverage the GPUs provided by Google Colab.

## Contents

This directory contains the following important files and resources:

- `global_urban_mapping_os.ipynb`: A Colab notebook designed for executing the global urban mapping process.

## Making Predictions
To initiate the urban mapping prediction with the `GUM` model, please refer to the instructions and code within `global_urban_mapping_opensource.ipynb`.
