# `Model` Directory

Welcome to the model directory of the Global Urban Mapper (GUM) project. This directory provides essential resources needed to use the `GUM` model, including the configuration file and the model file link.

## Contents

This directory contains the following important files:

- `unet_newest_version.py`: The configuration script for the GUM model detailing the model's parameters and operational settings for both training and inference phases.

- `model.pth`: A link to the pre-trained GUM model checkpoint. To utilize the model for prediction, you must download this checkpoint.

## Configuration File

The `unet_config.py` file is critical to the GUM model's operation, as it dictates the model's configurations for training and inference. Ensure you download both the configuration script and the model checkpoint, storing them in your Google Drive for seamless integration with prediction workflows.
