# `Model` Directory

Welcome to the model directory of the Global Urban Mapper (GUM) project. This directory provides essential resources needed to use the `GUM` model, including the configuration file and the model file link.

## Contents

This directory contains the following important files:

- `unet_newest_version.py`: The configuration script for the GUM model detailing the model's parameters and operational settings for both training and inference phases.

## Configuration File

The `unet_newest_version.py` file is critical to the GUM model's operation, as it dictates the model's configurations for training and inference. Ensure you download both the configuration script and the model checkpoint, storing them in your Google Drive for seamless integration with prediction workflows.

## Model Checkpoint Link
The link to the pre-trained GUM model could be found in [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a4KTUiLhznQqKqf0RaLjIc_3fxY95ZV1/view?usp=sharing). To utilize the model for prediction, you need to download this checkpoint.
