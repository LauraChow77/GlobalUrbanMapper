# Model Directory

Welcome to the model directory of the Global Urban Mapper (GUM) project. This directory provides essential resources needed to use the `GUM` model, including the configuration file and the model file link.

## Contents

This directory contains the following important files:

- `pspnet_unet_s5-d16.py`: This is the configuration file for the `GUM` model. It outlines the parameters and settings that the model uses during training and prediction.

- `model.pth`: This is the link to the pre-trained `GUM` model. You will need to download this model to use it for predictions.

- ## Configuration File

The `pspnet_unet_s5-d16.py` file is crucial for the functioning of the `GUM` model. It provides the configurations used during model training and prediction. 

If this configuration file doesn't already exist in your `mmsegmentation-master\configs\_base_\models` directory, you can place it there.
